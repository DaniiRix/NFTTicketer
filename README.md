<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

NFTTicketer is a platform transforming the ticketing business by making use of NFTs. Any artist/hackathon hoster/vendor can create NFT gated events using the NFTTicketer client.

The user will be given a URL to share with fans in order to sell NFT tickets to their performance!

Once the user receives their ticket, the merchant can use our QR code scanning software to check (via the blockchain) that they are the rightful owner of it and that it hasn't already been scanned.

All the NFT metadata is stored on the open network of IPFS with the help of Pinata and the client is hosted on the permissionless open network using Fleek.
